## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Order Summary Component challenge

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - This was a good one to practice flex elements. The background was a little tricky, but I figured out to solve the margin issue with background-size: contain attribute. After centering the card, I had some trouble in canceling the border radius of the botom of the image. I also faced some trouble in aligning the plan details, where I had to separe the information in order to the flex display yo work properly with the price and the change link. For last, but not lease, the buttons were a part the required some work. I had to cancel all its attributes in order to style it properly. Maybe, using Bootstrap would helped me a lot with this.
